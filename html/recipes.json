    "description" : "Making home fries the traditional way takes about an hour of standing over a hot skillet, after which you get only three servings at most. We wanted a quicker, more hands-off method for making a larger amount. To speed things up, we developed a hybrid cooking technique: First, we parboil diced russet potatoes, and then we coat them in oil and cook them in a very hot oven. We discovered that boiling the potatoes with baking soda quickly breaks down their exterior while leaving their insides nearly raw, ensuring home fries with a crisp, brown crust and a moist, fluffy interior. We added diced onions in the last 20 minutes of oven time and finished the home fries with chives to reinforce the onion flavor.",

They are also often peeled and split. This means they cook faster — half an hour is generally long enough to make many dals — and break down quickly. That texture is enhanced by a mathani, a kind of wooden beater or churner reminiscent of the molinillo used to froth Mexican hot chocolate. A mathani is fun to use — you rub the dowel end between your palms to twirl the action end in the dal, semi-puréeing it — but a whisk works pretty well, too, as might a molinillo, for that matter.",

    "description" : "This traditional Italian condiment is related to Spanish <em>salsa verde</em>, Italian <em>bagna cauda</em>, and Greek <em>skordalia</em>.  Another sauce with many uses, it is traditionally eaten with boiled meats and it delicious with pretty much anything else - in this case, marinated anchovies.  At Bar Tartine, we serve Bagnet Vert with Bolinas black cod, cilantro blossoms, and fennel tops.  The incorporation of bread transforms the sauce into something much more substantial, a sublime combination of aromatic flavors bound with bread.",
